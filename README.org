* Library/programming language for numerical software that formalizes the underlining mathematics using Lean programming language.

  Expected benefit of doing so:
    - optimizations base on underlining mathematics
    - code transformation such as automatic differentiation or inversion
    - high level control of limiting processes like discretization and solver steps
    - increase re-usability by abstracting over core mathematics
    - improved code readability

** Long Term Goal

   - Write finite element code where the energy/action can be written down like on paper and the final cede can be differentiated with respect to almost anything like domain, stiffness parameters, initial conditions etc.

   - Support compilation to GPU and CPU.

** Mid term Goal

   - Semi-automatic differentiation and optimization tools.
   - Inline C++ compiler to write efficient low level code.
   - Formalize and wrap OpenVDB, NanoVDB, Houdini, Eigen primitives.
   - Node based editor in Houdini.

** Short Term Goal

   My first goal is to write couple of simple ODE solvers maybe some simple finite difference solvers. The main things to focus on:
     - compare performance to hand written C++ code
     - attempt at semi-automatic differentiation of energy/lagrangian

*** TODO Lean Framework

   Implement these to in the order to get these examples working:
     1. Harmonic Oscilator
     2. Pendulum
     3. NBody
     4. NPendulum in 2D
     5. NPendulum in 3D
     6. 1D wave equation
     7. 2D wave equation

**** TODO Categories [/]
     - [ ] Implement `IsSmooth` - just duplicate IsDiff and add axiom that differential of smooth is smooth
     - [ ] Implement `IsLInv` `IsRInv`
     - [ ] experiment with `extends` keyword to chain categories properly and test if `IsInv` can be written just as an extension of `IsLInv` and `IsRInv`
     - [ ] Define Hom for categories and pick arrows
       - Lin:    ⊸  --o  \-o     
       - Smooth: ⟿ ~~>  \r~3	 
       - Dif:    ⇝ -~>  \r~2
       - Cont:   ↦ -->  \r6
       - Diffeo: ↭ <~>  \lr5
       - RInv:   ↠ ->> \r23
       - LInv:   ↪  >-> \r8
       - Inv:    ↔  <-> \lr
     - [ ] internalized combinators
     - [ ] extract smooth/linear/... symbol - this will create appropriate morphism
     - [ ] modify remove lambda let to work with morphisms
     - [ ] Specialized notation =λₛ= for morphisms, maybe also ascii version as =fun (x : X) ~~> (f x)= or =fun (v : V) --o (A v)=
     - [ ] Implement =IsCont= 
     - [ ] Add =IsDiffeo= a category of diffeomorphisms

**** TODO Computations [1/8]

     - [ ] add simple algebraic simplification, probably based on this [[https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/New.20attribute.20to.20mark.20theorems][zulip chat]]
       - Attempt 1: What the link suggest does not work naively in my case :(
     - [X] add =autodiff=, =autograd= tactics
     - [ ] make =rmlamlet= work in conv mode
     - [ ] rewrite =autodiff= and =autograd= to use conv mode
     - [ ] add =autodual= tactic
     - [ ] fix `remove lambda let` to work properly with `let` such that for loops are correctly abstracted
     - [ ] Add basic real functions like =sin, cos, exp= and their derivatives and inverses
     - [ ] =Vector T n= fixed sized array of type T
     - [ ] =Tensor #[n1, n2, n3]= fast float array to hold data - probably column major
     - [ ] =Vec2, Vec3, Vec4= simple fixed size vectors
     - [ ] =Mat2, Mat3, Mat4= simple fixed size matrices

**** TODO Solver class [3/9]

     - [X] add tactics =solver_check= and =solver_assumtion=
     - [X] add tactic =lift_limit=
     - [X] rewrite =Impl= based on [[https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Working.20with.20constants/near/256707931][Mario's answer]]
     - [ ] add tactic =assume_this=
     - [ ] add tactic =check_this=
     - [ ] refine =lift_limit=
           It should automatically call =assume_this= for assuming lifting of the limit
	   Based on how lift_limit currently works it should call one iteration of beta-reduction.
     - [ ] add tactic =finish_impl= probably just `apply Solver.pure`
     - [ ] check computability in =finish_impl=
           The approach is probably to replace every free variables in the target expression by their instance of `Inhabited`. For this use =Expr.replaceFVar=

           If the target is a function, synthesize all arguments with `Inhabited` and apply them.

	   Finally I need to figure out how to test if an expression can be evaluated.
	   
     - [ ] implement =assemble=
