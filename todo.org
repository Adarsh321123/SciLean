* First release

 - basic simulations from classical mechanics
 - basic variational calculus

* Library improvements

** Function predicates and their transitive closure
   Introduce transitive closure for function predicates like =IsSmooth=, =IsLin= etc. Take inspiration from =CoeT= or =MonadLiftT=, =Coe= itself is user facing typeclass that you provide instance for but when you actually use it you want to infer its transitive closure =CoeT=.

   The advantage is that we will can provide instances that derive =IsSmooth= from =IsLin= that can fail quickly. For example, deriving smoothness of =f ∘ g= you do not want to try composition of smooth function **and** composition of linear functions. You want to apply the composition theorem only once! Deriving smoothness from linearity should work only for atomic functions.

   - pros: =IsSmoothT= will be derivable from =IsLin=. Currently all predicates live in their own world and can't derive each other. This creates lots of repetition.
   - cons: For new users it might be difficult to understand the difference of =IsSmooth= and =IsSmoothT=. Maybe we can provide a linter for this.

** Generalize and unify =function_argument= notation

   The =function_argument= notation is messy and disorganized. Improve it.

** Autodiff, autoadjoint tactic and let bindings

   Correctly and efficiently differentiate through let bindings. There is already some work on this in =SciLean/Tactic/AutoDiff=

   - focus on differential and adjoint first (worry about adjDiff, fwdDiff, revDiff later)
   - make it work as a single pass. Differentiation should be done on a single traversal
   - maybe add an option that checks if differential/adjoint is fully eliminated

** Guard for simp

   I would like to have a guard for certain simp theorems. Currently I use =hold= trick to prevent some simp theorems to apply to theorems to apply to themselves. Alternatively we could say that this simp theorem applies only if a certain functions does not unify to identity. There is also a case for product projections.
   
** Set up more robust testing

   Usually when I develop something temporary tests for it. So maybe allow for tests through out the code base.

* Diffeological spaces and tangent space

  Define diffeological space and its tangent space, smooth function between them and differential

  The question what notion of tangent space should we use? Maybe we can use only diffeological spaces that are convenient vector spaces or their subsets and quotients.

* Differentiability at point

  Try define smoothenss/differentiability at a point. I really want to work with =1/x= without problems and assume that it is differentiable for every =x≠0=.
  
* Machine learning

 - table interface
 - back propagation
 - simple fully connected network

* CPU & GPU compiling

  - separate repo [[https://github.com/lecopivo/lean4-karray][lean-karray]]

* Houdini integration

  - Basic data transfer
    - Make detail glob attribute holding lean data
    - NArray <-> Houdini Volume
    - Prismatic mesh <-> Houdini geometry
    - NArray <-> Geometry attributes

  - Basic wrangle node

* Mesh

  - Prism
  - Prismatic mesh
    - presheaf on Prism
    - generalization of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_set][delta set]]
  - product of meshes

  - conversion for simplicial complex to Prismatic Mesh
  - conversion of cell complex (made out of prisms) to Prismatic Mesh
    I do not think this is in general possible. Probably possible only after certain subdivision.
  
* Runtime symbolic module

  - working with polynomials, differential forms, tensor products

**  Goal is to get isomophisms:
    
    𝓟[U×V, K] ≅ 𝓟[U, 𝓟[V, K]]
    
  - Using these isomorphisms we can get polynomial to a form 𝓟[ℝ, K] and on that we can define HornerForm is K has HornerForm

  - In some sense these ismorphisms must be true:

    𝓐[U×V, K] ≅ 𝓐[U, 𝓐[V, K]]
    
    𝓐[U×V, 𝓟[U×V]] ≅ 𝓐[U, 𝓟[U, 𝓐[V, 𝓟[V]]]]

    Is this the most efficient way to evaluate differential forms?
    
    Define right and left smul for algebras! Then I should be able to do

    𝓐[U×V, K] ≅ 𝓐[U, 𝓐[V, K]]

* Finite Element

  - define finite element over Prism
  - define global finite element space
  - system assembly

* Approximating Spaces

  - Define abstract interface for a type to approximate another type
  - will be usefull for creating finite elements, hybrid methods
    or finite elements

* Manifolds through Quot

  - If I have a projection on vector space X. There is quite reasonable definition of smooth math on the quotient.

* Invertible programming

  - investigate more how to generate inverses
  - define left and right inverses
  - watch out for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice#In_constructive_mathematics][axiom of choice]]
  - array modification
