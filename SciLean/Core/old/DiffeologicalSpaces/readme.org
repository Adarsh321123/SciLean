* Diffeological Spaces

Extend differentiation beyond vector spaces e.g. types like =X⊕Y= or ={x // |x|=1}=

Goals:
 - Define smoothness for functions =X->Y= where =X= and =Y= are something like manifolds.
 - Define differential =∂ : (f : X→Y) → (x : X) → 𝒯[x] X → 𝒯[f x] Y=

Note: This does not attempt to define covariant derivative/general connection that could differentiate general dependently typed function =f : (x : X) → Y x=. For an attempt at this see SciLean/Experimental/Connection
